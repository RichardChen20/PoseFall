## Posefall
This repository contains two fall detection projects. The first one is a video based fall detection approach https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14633, which takes 300 frames of 2D poses to detect whether there is a fall behaviour. The other is a fall detection system on ROS based on single frame 2D pose.

A lot of work needs to be done, please keep patient, thank you!
