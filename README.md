## Posefall
This repository contains two fall detection projects. 

The first one is a video based fall detection approach https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14633, which takes 300 frames of 2D poses to detect whether there is a fall behaviour. The experiments were conducted on NTU RGBD dataset, we refer to codes from https://github.com/kchengiva/DecoupleGCN-DropGraph to train and evaluate our model. Only codes for our fall detection model is provided in this repository because...I'm lazy... Cleaning up the codes is quite time-comsuming and my research interest is not action recognition.

The other is a fall detection system on ROS based on single frame 2D pose.

I do not plan to update this repository detaily, you can send messages to me if you are interested in this work.
